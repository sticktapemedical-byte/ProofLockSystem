# ProofLock

ProofLock is an offline software tool that creates tamper-evident proof for screenshots and screen recordings.

It allows users to lock image or video files by generating a cryptographic hash and timestamp. Once locked, any modification to the file can be detected later, helping preserve file integrity and creation timing.

ProofLock works entirely on the user’s device. It does not require accounts, cloud services, data uploads, or external verification systems.

## How ProofLock Works

1. Select a screenshot or screen recording
2. Generate a cryptographic hash and timestamp
3. Optionally apply a local digital signature (“Operator”)
4. Export the locked file and proof metadata
5. Verify integrity offline at any time

ProofLock verifies file integrity and timing only. It does not verify the accuracy, truth, authorship, or ownership of content.

## Proof Credits

ProofLock uses proof credits on a per-file basis.

Users purchase proof credits to lock image or video files locally. Credits are stored on the device and are consumed only when a proof is successfully generated.

Proof credits are local-only and are not recoverable if the application is removed.
