  <h1>ProofLock</h1>

  <p>
    ProofLock is an offline software tool that creates tamper-evident proof
    for screenshots and screen recordings.
  </p>

  <p>
    ProofLock allows users to lock image or video files by generating a
    cryptographic hash and timestamp. Once locked, any change to the file
    can be detected.
  </p>

  <p>
    ProofLock works entirely on the user's device and does not require
    accounts, cloud services, or data uploads. Users purchase proof credits
    to lock media files locally.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Select an image or screen recording</li>
    <li>Generate cryptographic proof and timestamp</li>
    <li>Optionally apply a local digital signature</li>
    <li>Verify file integrity offline at any time</li>
  </ul>

    ProofLock verifies file integrity and timestamps only.
    It does not verify the accuracy, truth, or authorship of content.
